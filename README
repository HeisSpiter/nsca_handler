nsca_handler is a tool that has been designed to run with Icinga/Nagios in case of a distributed/redundant monitoring. It prevents from calling send_nsca right from Icinga/Nagios, and thus adding a deadtime in case of connection limitation. This delegates treatment to parallel application.

Its behaviour is simple. It will read directory that contains files each time a change occurs and will send everything to the other host using nsca_send.

nsca_handler does not take any argument (edit source code...). Run it, it will fork in background. Kill it with signals.

Before you actually compile and deploy the application, please properly set these parameters in code:
NSCA_SEND_CMD
NSCA_OUTPUT_DIR

This has been specifically designed for the ReactOS Foundation infrastructure, but we are open to suggestions and patches :-).

Pieces of documentation and code can be found on the Wiki at: https://github.com/HeisSpiter/nsca_handler/wiki.
